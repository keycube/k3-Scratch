## Introduction
During my internship, I aimed to push the limits of Scratch by creating Keyrun, a complex typing game that integrates the innovative Keycube keyboard. This game features retrowave aesthetics and challenging gameplay mechanics.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this internship were:
- To explore and utilize advanced features of Scratch.
- To create a game that showcases the versatility and potential of Scratch.
- To document the process and findings comprehensively.

## Methodology
My approach involved:
1. Researching advanced Scratch techniques.
2. Designing and developing the game using the keycube.
3. Testing and refining the game to ensure functionality and engagement.
4. Documenting each step of the process.

## Project Structure
### Game Overview
Keyrun is a typing game with a retrowave style where players must type letters to make cubes disappear before losing their three lives. The game gets progressively faster, challenging the player's typing speed and accuracy.

### Technical Details
- **keycube Integration:** Each line in the game corresponds to a face of the keycube.
- **Optimization:** Utilized numerous variables to replace initial numbers in blocks, reducing operations and improving performance.
- **Workarounds for Scratch Limitations:** Created animations and videos by dividing them into images and using sprite costumes.

### Development Tools
- **Scratch:** For game development and animation.
- [Go to Scratch page](Scratch.md)

- **Blender:** For creating the 3D retrowave background and cubes.
- [Go to Blender page](Blender.md)

- **Figma:** For designing the game model.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Learning Curve:** Overcame the steep learning curve of Scratch and its interface through rigorous practice and study.
- **Block Constraints:** Managed constraints by optimizing code and using creative workarounds for features not supported by Scratch.
- **Bugs and Performance Issues:** Addressed numerous bugs, including the score increase issue and sprite initialization.
